            <p class="lead">PowerfulWomen is an online organization created by 4 teenage girls: Veatriki, Konstantina, Elpida and Lydia, who dream of a world, where all women are valued and acknowledged.</p>
            <p class="lead">The main goal of our organization is the recognition of women's unalienable Human Rights by society. We aim to ensure that all women have access to education and are treated fairly and equally in the workplace.</p>
            <p class="lead">The organization first started as a group project, where we had to choose a current issue of today's society and present it to our classmates. We soon realized, though, that the issue was far more important than a simple school project. We decided, therefore, to create this organization and become part of a larger movement to ensure equality between the genders worldwide.</p>
